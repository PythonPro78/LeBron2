# **Unit Testing w/ LeBron James**
### Advanced Java Class
### 3/30/2025

Students were required to create a Java project themed around NBA star LeBron James and baseball celebrity Bo Jackson (we voted on the theme and this is what we landed on). 
The purpose of the assignment was to test students' ability to create unit tests for a coding application in InteliJ.
